# Weekend at Bernie's

Data collection for [Weekend at Bernie's](https://nesbitt.io/2026/05/08/weekend-at-bernies.html), a blog post and talk on widely used open source packages that are effectively dead but still propped up in production everywhere. Pulls the `critical=true` package set from [packages.ecosyste.ms](https://packages.ecosyste.ms), enriches each backing repo with commit, issue, advisory and dependency data from the other ecosyste.ms services, then buckets repos into active / dormant / dead / unknown.

The failure mode we care about: a security report or a breaking dependency update lands and there is nobody left with commit or publish rights to respond. That used to be a slow-moving risk because nobody was auditing 200-line utilities from 2017. AI-assisted vulnerability discovery changes the rate at which those reports arrive without changing the number of people able to act on them.

## Setup

    bundle install

Run the tests with:

    ruby -Itest -e 'Dir.glob("test/*_test.rb").sort.each { |file| require_relative file }'

## Pipeline

    ruby fetch.rb            # critical packages -> bernies.db (packages + repos tables)
    ruby repos.rb            # refresh pushed_at/archived from repos.ecosyste.ms
    ruby commits.rb          # past-year commit/committer counts, bot split, dds
    ruby issues.rb           # past-year issue/PR activity, active_maintainers
    ruby advisories.rb       # per-package advisories, patched/unpatched
    ruby classify.rb         # bucket repos using whatever signals are present
    ruby clone.rb            # shallow-clone non-active repos for true last_commit_at
    ruby deps.rb             # dependency drift (majors behind) for non-active packages
    ruby classify.rb         # re-bucket

    NOTE: Need to run the ruby script under Remediation section to update db schema.

    ruby report.rb           # stats + out/*.csv

`fetch.rb` defaults to all sixteen upstream registries; pass names to limit (`ruby fetch.rb rubygems.org hex.pm`). HTTP responses are cached under `cache/<step>/` keyed by URL. `repos.rb`, `commits.rb` and `issues.rb` skip rows already synced; `advisories.rb` reprocesses cached responses on each run. These four enrichment scripts take an optional row limit.

Pass `--refresh` to `fetch.rb`, `mydataset.rb`, `repos.rb`, `commits.rb`, `issues.rb`, `advisories.rb`, `owners.rb`, `maintainers.rb`, `orgs.rb`, `emails.rb`, `clone.rb`, `deps.rb`, `dependents.rb` or `size.rb` to bypass saved responses and revisit previously collected rows. For example, `ruby issues.rb --refresh 10` refreshes the first ten repositories. Row limits and supported ecosystem and bucket filters still apply; `--refresh` does not imply `--all`. Advisory withdrawals are stored and excluded from advisory counts and `unpatched.csv`.

Run `owners.rb` before `maintainers.rb`, `orgs.rb` or `emails.rb`. Owner refreshes fetch directly from the repository service instead of using embedded package caches. Email refreshes replace each selected user's email list and repeat DNS and WHOIS checks for all domains in the saved email lists; the row limit applies only to users. Failed refreshes preserve previous observations. Successful dependency and dependent refreshes replace their saved lists, removing entries absent from the new response.

After collecting fresh data, rerun `classify.rb`, `situate.rb` and `report.rb` to update derived results and exports. `situate.rb` recomputes heuristic values on each run, preserves human and LLM decisions, and rejects `--refresh` because it has no fetch or cache to refresh.

Package imports preserve repository fields once `repos.rb` has saved a source sync date. Refresh those fields through `repos.rb --refresh`; importing packages again updates package fields without replacing directly collected repository data.

`mydataset.rb`, `repos.rb` and `owners.rb` save unresolved lookups in the selected database, with the package, repository or owner identity, endpoint, HTTP status and failure reason. Repository failures also include the GitHub status when checked. A later successful lookup clears its entry. Failed responses are not cached, and reruns retry recorded failures even when older metadata is present; legacy `null` cache entries are fetched again to establish their status.

Pass `--failures FILE` to any of those three commands to export its unresolved lookups as CSV, for example `ruby repos.rb --failures out/repo-failures.csv`. The file is replaced on each export. `report.rb` writes all recorded failures to `out/lookup-failures.csv`, including package names associated with a failed repository. `repository_service_miss` means GitHub returned a repository page while the repository service returned 404; `repository_not_found` means both returned 404. A 404 can also mean a private or otherwise unavailable resource. Rate limits, server errors and timeouts have separate reasons, and unknown HTTP statuses remain blank.

The signals stack as proofs of life: a recent release, a recent default-branch commit, an active issue maintainer or a merged PR is enough to mark a repo alive and skip the expensive checks. Run `classify.rb` between steps; `clone.rb` and `deps.rb` skip repos already bucketed `active` (pass `--all` to override). `clone.rb` does a `--depth 1 --bare --filter=blob:none` clone per repo to read the real default-branch HEAD date, since `pushed_at` from the API covers any branch and lags. `deps.rb` measures drift: for each package's latest release it fetches the declared direct dependencies, looks up each dep's current latest, and records `majors_behind`.

Some repos won't be indexed by the issues or commits services yet. The lookup triggers a background sync, so rerunning `ruby issues.rb --refresh` and `ruby commits.rb --refresh` a day or two later can fill more in. Until then those repos sit in `unknown`.

## Custom package lists

`mydataset.rb` imports a CSV list of Ruby gems. Each row contains `pkg:gem`, the gem name and an optional comment. There is no header; blank lines are skipped and comments are ignored. Quote comments that contain commas.

    pkg:gem, ruby_rncryptor_secured
    pkg:gem, bundle-audit, check advisories

Use a separate database to restrict enrichment and classification to your list:

    export BERNIES_DB=mydataset.db
    ruby mydataset.rb ./mydata.txt
    ruby repos.rb
    ruby commits.rb
    ruby issues.rb
    ruby advisories.rb
    ruby classify.rb
    ruby owners.rb
    ruby maintainers.rb
    ruby orgs.rb
    ruby emails.rb
    ruby clone.rb
    ruby deps.rb
    ruby dependents.rb
    ruby size.rb
    ruby classify.rb
    ruby situate.rb
    ruby report.rb

This replaces the `fetch.rb` step. Running `fetch.rb` afterward also imports the critical-package collection. All database commands use `BERNIES_DB`, including the remediation, tagging and domain follow-up scripts. Relative database paths are resolved against the scripts' directory. Run `owners.rb` before the maintainer, organisation and email collectors, and `deps.rb`, `dependents.rb` and `size.rb` before `situate.rb` and the remediation reports.

Custom exports go beside the database: `mydataset.db.output/out/` contains reports and the tag review sheet, and `mydataset.db.output/findings/` contains per-ecosystem CSVs. For example, export with `ruby tag.rb`, then import edits with `ruby tag.rb --import mydataset.db.output/out/tag.csv` while `BERNIES_DB` remains set. Commands print their output paths. Explicit paths passed to `--import` or `--failures` are used as supplied.

With the default `bernies.db`, exports still use the existing `out/` and `findings/` directories. Remote response caches remain shared; owner imports are restricted to the selected dataset, and cached LLM results require matching prompt inputs and model. Unset `BERNIES_DB` to return to the default dataset.

The importer validates all rows before making requests or writing data. Duplicate entries are fetched once. Missing or unavailable packages are reported, valid packages are imported, and the command exits with a nonzero status if any lookup fails. Re-running updates existing entries without deleting packages omitted from the file. Responses are cached under `cache/mydataset`; use `ruby mydataset.rb --refresh ./mydata.txt` to fetch them again.

## Science projects

`fetch_science.rb` collects the top projects from [science.ecosyste.ms](https://science.ecosyste.ms) into `science-bernies.db`. The order matches the projects page, which ranks projects by science score plus the general project score. The default cohort is 2,000 projects; pass another number to change it.

    ruby fetch_science.rb 2000
    BERNIES_DB=science-bernies.db ruby repos.rb
    BERNIES_DB=science-bernies.db ruby commits.rb
    BERNIES_DB=science-bernies.db ruby issues.rb
    BERNIES_DB=science-bernies.db ruby advisories.rb
    BERNIES_DB=science-bernies.db ruby classify.rb
    ruby report_science.rb

The collector stores the science rank, score, citations, category and owner metadata, along with any packages published from the repository. The normal enrichment scripts then collect the same repository activity, maintainer response and advisory signals used for the package dataset. With its default `science-bernies.db`, `report_science.rb` writes `out/science-projects.csv`, `out/science-bernies.csv` and `out/science-buckets.csv`. A different `BERNIES_DB` places these files in `<database>.output/out/` beside that database.

The science API does not currently return `science_score` or allow API sorting by it, so cohort selection reads the public projects listing and fetches each selected project from the JSON API. Responses are cached under `cache/science`; remove that directory to collect a new ranking.

## Buckets

  * **active**: regular human commits in the past year, or a release in the last year
  * **dormant**: little or no development but someone with write access is still around: closing issues, merging PRs, committing occasionally. A fix could plausibly land.
  * **dead**: archived, or someone filed an issue/PR in the past year and nobody with write access responded, merged, closed, committed or released anything
  * **unknown**: nobody filed anything and nothing happened; responsiveness is untested. Also covers repos the issues service hasn't indexed.

`dead` is deliberately a hard claim: it requires evidence that someone knocked and nobody answered. Zero commits is never sufficient on its own; a finished package with no commits in five years whose author would still merge a security fix is dormant, not dead. Thresholds live at the top of `classify.rb` and the `signals` column on each repo records the raw inputs so cutoffs can be argued over with `SELECT` rather than re-collection.

Archive status and rolling commit and issue counts support classification only when their source sync date is at most 365 days old. Missing, invalid or future sync dates also exclude those observations. The saved values remain available, and `signals` identifies excluded sources with entries such as `issues:stale` or `commits:missing`. Dated releases, pushes and individual commits still use the existing one-year activity window; without usable evidence, the result is `unknown`. Refreshing a response does not make its contents current if the service still returns an old sync date.

The main, per-bucket and remediation reports include repository, commit and issue sync dates alongside `classified_at`. Remediation exports also include `signals`, so an `unknown` result can be checked against missing or stale observations.

## Remediation

Bucketing tells you whether anyone is home; remediation asks what a dependent should do about it: what shape the package is (small enough to vendor? one big consumer who should adopt? maintained successor exists?) and what the recommended action is. See `remediation.md` for the full taxonomy.

    ruby dependents.rb --ecosystem rubygems   # top-N dependent packages, top1/top5 concentration, transit_ratio
    ruby size.rb       --ecosystem rubygems   # shallow clone, brief + scc, README deprecation grep
    ruby situate.rb                           # heuristic situation pre-fill from the above
    ruby llm.rb        --ecosystem rubygems   # claude -p with json-schema fills situation/remediation
    ruby tag.rb        --ecosystem rubygems   # export out/tag.csv for human review
    ruby tag.rb --import out/tag.csv          # write reviewed rows back
    ruby report.rb                            # adds out/remediation.{csv,json}

`dependents.rb` and `size.rb` cache results, take an optional row limit, and skip `bucket='active'` by default. Both accept `--refresh`, `--all` and `--ecosystem NAME`; `size.rb` also accepts `--bucket NAME` to target a specific bucket. `situate.rb` accepts only `--all`. `size.rb` needs `brief` and `scc` on PATH. `llm.rb` shells out to `claude -p` with a JSON schema, model overridable via `BERNIES_MODEL`. `dependents.rb` computes `transit_ratio` (sum of top-N dependents' downloads ÷ this package's downloads) as a direct-vs-transitive proxy, falling back to `dependent_repos_count` on registries without download data (go, maven, swiftpm).

Each row carries `remediation_source` (heuristic / llm / human) so downstream consumers can weight it. `situate.rb` won't overwrite llm or human rows; `llm.rb` won't overwrite human rows. The intended output is developer-facing guidance, so high-blast-radius packages should pass through `tag.rb` review before being published.

    ruby export_ecosystem.rb cargo            # per-ecosystem dead+dormant -> out/cargo-bernies.csv

## Database

Everything lands in `bernies.db` (sqlite, WAL mode):

  * `packages`: one row per critical package (purl). Registry, dependent counts, downloads, latest release, registry maintainers, dep-drift rollups, `top1_share`/`top5_share`/`transit_ratio`, `situation`/`remediation`/`alternative_purl`/`remediation_source`.
  * `repos`: one row per repository_url. Repo metadata, commit/issue stats, clone result, advisory rollups, bucket, signals, `code_loc`/`complexity`/`entry_points`/`has_native` from `size.rb`.
  * `advisories`: one row per (purl, advisory). Severity, CVSS, vulnerable range, first_patched_version, patched flag.
  * `lookup_failures`: unresolved package, repository and owner lookups, with endpoint, status, reason and last attempt time.
  * `dependencies`: one row per (purl, dep). Requirement, dep's current latest, majors_behind, runtime/dev kind.
  * `dependents`: one row per (purl, rank). Top-N dependent packages by downloads, with description.

Some queries:

    sqlite3 bernies.db "SELECT bucket, COUNT(*) FROM repos GROUP BY bucket"

    sqlite3 bernies.db "SELECT p.name, p.dependent_repos, r.days_since_release, r.active_maintainers_count
                        FROM packages p JOIN repos r USING (repository_url)
                        WHERE p.ecosystem='npm' AND r.bucket='dead'
                        ORDER BY p.dependent_repos DESC LIMIT 20"

    sqlite3 bernies.db "SELECT r.bucket, COUNT(*) FROM repos r
                        WHERE r.past_year_bot_prs > 0 AND r.past_year_prs_merged = 0
                        GROUP BY r.bucket"

## Output

  * `out/bernies.csv`: every dead or dormant repo ranked by `dependent_repos`, with all activity signals and advisory counts. An existing advisory means that one has already been hit; the rest are exposed to the same outcome the next time someone goes looking.
  * `out/dead.csv`, `out/dormant.csv`: per-bucket subsets with the same columns.
  * `out/unpatched.csv`: advisories with no recorded `first_patched_version` for any affected range of the package, across all buckets. A patched version on one range is enough to exclude the advisory, even if other ranges have missing patch metadata. This does not imply every affected release line received a patch.
  * `out/buckets-by-ecosystem.csv`: active/dormant/dead/unknown counts and dead% per ecosystem.
  * `out/remediation.csv`, `out/remediation.json`: every non-active package with `situation`, `remediation`, `alternative_purl`, `remediation_source`, `llm_confidence`, top dependent, code size and complexity.
  * `findings/<lang>.csv`: same columns as `remediation.csv`, one file per ecosystem alongside the writeup (e.g. `findings/ruby.csv` for rubygems).
  * `out/tag.csv`: review sheet from `tag.rb`; edit and reimport.
  * `out/lookup-failures.csv`: unresolved lookups across the import, repository and owner collectors.
  * `out/<ecosystem>-bernies.csv`: per-ecosystem dead+dormant export from `export_ecosystem.rb`.

## First full run (Apr 2026)

8606 critical packages across 16 registries, 5874 distinct repos.

| bucket  | repos | share |
|---------|------:|------:|
| active  | 2864  | 48.8% |
| dormant | 1184  | 20.2% |
| dead    |  713  | 12.1% |
| unknown | 1113  | 18.9% |

117 advisories have no fixed release. The `unknown` 18.9% are repos so quiet that nobody has filed an issue or PR in a year, so the question hasn't been asked.

| ecosystem | repos | active | dormant | dead | unknown | dead % |
|-----------|------:|-------:|--------:|-----:|--------:|-------:|

| cpan      |   10  |   5    |   2     |   3  |   0     | 30.0   |

Repos appear under every ecosystem they publish to, so the column totals exceed 5874.

See `notes.md` for caveats and signal definitions, `remediation.md` for the situation/remediation taxonomy, [`findings/`](findings/) for per-ecosystem remediation writeups (rubygems is `findings/ruby.md`), [`owners/`](owners/) for the maintainer-and-organisation analysis (who owns the bernies, are they still around, what the funding picture looks like), and `todo.md` for what's next.

## bernie-check skill

[`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) is a self-contained Claude Code skill for assessing a single repository on demand, separate from the bulk pipeline above. Given a repository URL (or run from inside a git repo with an `origin` remote), it pulls fresh data from the ecosyste.ms `/repositories/lookup` endpoints and applies the same classification logic as `classify.rb`. For repos that classify as dead or dormant it then looks at the owner side: for individuals, maintenance engagement via `issues.ecosyste.ms /authors/<login>` and recent push activity across all their repos; for organisations, bus factor via `/owners/<org>/maintainers` with bot accounts excluded.

For security posture it fetches the OSSF Scorecard live from `api.securityscorecards.dev`, checks `SECURITY.md` and threat-model file presence via the ecosyste.ms files map, reads GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting status via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/private-vulnerability-reporting`, and pulls unpatched advisories from `advisories.ecosyste.ms`. The output is mapped onto the same `accept / vendor / switch / switch-piecemeal / adopt` taxonomy used in [`findings/`](findings/).

Intended for someone reviewing a dependency tree, doing a security audit, or evaluating a library before adopting it. The output is a one-screen report.

Requirements: `bash`, `curl`, `ruby`, and `gh` CLI authenticated to a GitHub account. The ecosyste.ms calls are unauthenticated; only the PVR check uses `gh`.

Install by copying `SKILL.md` into a Claude Code skills directory (typically `.claude/skills/bernie-check/SKILL.md` for project-local, or `~/.claude/skills/bernie-check/SKILL.md` for global).
